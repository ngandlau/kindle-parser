# Levels of Life (Barnes, Julian)

> Ballooning represented freedom - yet a freedom subservient to the powers of wind and weather.

> the three supreme emblems of modernity were 'photography, electricity and aeronautics'.

> To mess with flight was to mess with God.

> he thought juries should ask not 'Is he guilty?' but rather 'Is he dangerous?'

> Photography, like jazz, was a sudden, contemporary art which achieved technical excellence very quickly.

> He relaxed his subjects with chatter, while modelling them with lamps, screens, veils, mirrors and reflectors.

> The addition of photography, however, would clearly give any half-competent general the edge.

> Once, the peasant had looked up at the heavens, where God lived, fearing thunder, hail, and God's anger, hoping for sun, a rainbow, and God's approval. Now, the modern peasant looked up at the heavens and saw instead the less daunting arrival of Colonel Fred Burnaby, cigar in one pocket and half-sovereign in the other, of Sarah Bernhardt and her autobiographical chair, of FÃ©lix Tournachon in his airborne wicker cottage, complete with refreshment room, lavatory and photographic department.

> I think it struck everybody that here we'd come 240,000 miles to see the Moon

> I think it struck everybody that here we'd come 240,000 miles to see the Moon and it was the Earth that was really worth looking

> I think it struck everybody that here we'd come 240,000 miles to see the Moon and it was the Earth that was really worth looking at.

> You put together two people who have not been put together before; and sometimes the world is changed, sometimes not. They may crash and burn, or burn and crash. But sometimes, something new is made, and then the world is changed. Together, in that first exaltation, that first roaring sense of uplift, they are greater than their two separate selves. Together, they see further, and they see more clearly.

> But imagine a pair of lovers, one able to write privately and at length on both sides of the page, and hide the tenderest words in an envelope; the other constrained by brevity and the knowledge that private feelings might be publicly inspected by photographers and postmen. Although - isn't that how love sometimes feels, and works?

> Some soar with art, others with religion; most with love. But when we soar, we can also crash.

> Every love story is a potential grief story. If not at first, then later. If not for one, then for the other. Sometimes, for both.

> So why do we constantly aspire to love? Because love is the meeting point of truth and magic. Truth, as in photography; magic, as in ballooning.

> 'Madame Sarah, I would visit you by any means of transportation now or yet to be invented, were you in Paris or in Timbuctoo.'

> He was, he admitted, half confused and probably three-quarters in love.

> The small time he had spent with her aroused the desire for greater time, for all time.

> The small distance they had travelled from the theatre to the rue Fortuny aroused a desire to travel greater distances:

> Fred Burnaby was not like this. And neither was Madame Sarah. She had not used flirtatiousness with him. Or rather, her flirtatiousness was not a fraud, not a tactic, but a promise. Her eyes and her smile had been a proposal, an offer which he had accepted.

> Love would change her, as it was changing him. How, he did not exactly know.

> My heart desires more excitement than anyone - any one person - can give.'

> it was just that her love had a timing switch built into it.

> You put together two people who have not been put together before. Sometimes it is like that first attempt to harness a hydrogen balloon to a fire balloon: do you prefer crash and burn, or burn and crash? But sometimes it works, and something new is made, and the world is changed. Then, at some point, sooner or later, for this reason or that, one of them is taken away. And what is taken away is greater than the sum of what was there. This may not be mathematically possible; but it is emotionally possible.

> Early in life, the world divides crudely into those who have had sex and those who haven't. Later, into those who have known love, and those who haven't. Later still - at least, if we are lucky (or, on the other hand, unlucky) - it divides into those who have endured grief, and those who haven't.

> We were together for thirty years. I was thirty-two when we met, sixty-two when she died. The heart of my life; the life of my heart. And though she hated the idea of growing old - in her twenties, she thought she would never live past forty - I happily looked forward to our continuing life together: to things becoming slower and calmer, to collaborative recollection. I could imagine myself taking care of her; I could even - though I didn't - have imagined myself, like Nadar, easing the hair from her aphasiac temples, learning the part of the tender nurse

> read by a woman novelist about the death of her older husband. Amid her grief, she admitted, there was a small inner voice of truth murmuring to her, 'I'm free.'

> They said that the whole financial system might be about to crash and burn, but this didn't bother me. Money could not have saved her, so what good was money, and what was the point in saving its neck?

> They said that the whole financial system might be about to crash and burn, but this didn't bother me. Money could not have saved her, so what good was money, and what was the point in saving its neck? They said the world's climate was reaching a point of no return, but it could go to that point and beyond for all it mattered to me.

> I do not believe I shall ever see her again. Never see, hear, touch, embrace, listen to, laugh with; never again wait for her footstep, smile at the sound of an opening door, fit her body into mine, mine into hers. Nor do I believe we shall meet again in some dematerialised form. I believe dead is dead.

> At times it feels as if life itself is the greatest loser, the true bereaved party, because it is no longer subjected to that radiant curiosity of hers.

> what happiness is there in just the

> what happiness is there in just the

> what happiness is there in just the memory of happiness?

> As for doing what I liked: for me, this usually meant doing things with her.

> As for doing what I liked: for me, this usually meant doing things with her. Insofar as I liked doing things by myself, it was partly for the pleasure of telling her about them afterwards.

> Just as, when something failed, was broken or mislaid, I would reassure myself with: 'On the scale of loss, it is nothing.'

> You feel sharply the loss of shared vocabulary, of tropes, teases, short cuts, injokes, sillinesses, faux rebukes, amatory footnotes - all those obscure references rich in memory but valueless if explained to an outsider.

> could not kill myself because then I would also be killing her. She would die a second time, my lustrous memories of her fading as the bathwater turned red.

> Sometimes in these dreams we kiss; always there is a kind of laughing lightness to the scenario.

> 'I wish you had met her, and so met more of me.'

> am convinced that the Yes I uttered on our wedding day was an expression of the most complete and the most unambiguous certainty that I have ever felt. A certainty more absolute than any I have felt about my vocation.

> This is what those who haven't crossed the tropic of grief often fail to understand: the fact that someone is dead may mean that they are not alive, but doesn't mean that they do not exist.

> How could it be, because it can no longer be corroborated by the one who was there at the time. What we did, where we went, whom we met, how we felt. How we were together. All that. 'We' are now watered down to 'I'. Binocular memory has become monocular. There is no longer the possibility of assembling from two uncertain memories of the same event a surer, single one, by triangulation, by aerial surveying.

> There are two essential kinds of loneliness: that of not having found someone to love, and that of having been deprived of the one you did love. The first kind is worse. Nothing can compare to the loneliness of the soul in adolescence.

> Studies of cancer patients show that attitudes of mind have very little effect on clinical outcome. We may say we are fighting cancer, but cancer is merely fighting us;

> All that has happened is that from somewhere - or nowhere - an unexpected breeze has sprung up, and we are in movement again. But where are we being taken? To Essex? The German Ocean? Or, if that wind is a northerly, then, perhaps, with luck, to France.
