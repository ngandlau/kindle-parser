# Measure What Matters (John Doerr)

> As the eighteenth search engine to arrive on the web, the company was way late to the party.

> I'd first used it in the 1970s as an engineer at Intel, where Andy Grove, the greatest manager of his or any era, ran the best-run company I had ever seen.

> Objectives and Key Results.

> An OBJECTIVE, I explained, is simply WHAT is to be achieved, no more and no less. By definition, objectives are significant, concrete, action oriented, and (ideally) inspirational. When properly designed and deployed, they're a vaccine against fuzzy thinking—and fuzzy execution.

> KEY RESULTS benchmark and monitor HOW we get to the objective. Effective KRs are specific and time-bound, aggressive yet realistic. Most of all, they are measurable and verifiable. (As prize pupil Marissa Mayer would say, "It's not a key result unless it has a number.") You either meet a key result's requirements or you don't; there is no gray area, no room for doubt.

> First, said Edwin Locke, "hard goals" drive performance more effectively than easy goals. Second, specific hard goals "produce a higher level of output" than vaguely worded ones.

> productivity is enhanced by well-defined, challenging goals.

> no single factor has more impact than "clearly defined goals that are written down and shared freely. . . . Goals create alignment, clarity, and job satisfaction."

> At Intel, he went on, "we tend to be exactly the opposite. It almost doesn't matter what you know. It's what you can do with whatever you know or can acquire and actually accomplish [that] tends to be valued here." Hence the company's slogan: "Intel delivers."

> The objective is the direction: "We want to dominate the mid-range microcomputer component business." That's an objective. That's where we're going to go. Key results for this quarter: "Win ten new designs for the 8085" is one key result. It's a milestone. The two are not the same. . . . The key result has to be measurable. But at the end you can look, and without any arguments: Did I do that or did

But at the end you can look, and without any arguments: Did I do that or did I not do it? Yes? No? Simple. No judgments in it.

> A corporation, he wrote, should be a community "built on trust and respect for the workers—not just a profit machine."

> "create an environment that values and emphasizes output"

> At Intel, Andy recruited "aggressive introverts" in his own image, people who solved problems quickly, objectively, systematically, and permanently. Following his lead, they were skilled at confronting a problem without attacking the person. They set politics aside to make faster, sounder, more collective decisions.

> Then I posted a hard copy on my carrel for people to scan as they walked by. I'd never worked at a place where you wrote down your goals, much less where you could see everybody else's, on up to the CEO.

> If the vectors point in different directions, they add up to zero. But if you get everybody pointing in the same direction, you maximize the results.

> We were all taught that if you measured it, things got better.

> Measuring what matters begins with the question: What is most important for the next three (or six, or twelve) months?

> Key results are more earthbound and metric-driven. They typically include hard numbers for one or more gauges: revenue, growth, active users, quality, safety, market share, customer engagement.

> As Steve Jobs understood, "Innovation means saying no to one thousand things."

> When summer school teachers made daily phone calls and sent texts or written messages home, their sixth-graders completed 42 percent more homework. Class participation rose by nearly half.

> stepping into the bathroom of his tiny loft office and seeing a list of company objectives taped to the mirror,

> "Okay, let's just pick one and talk about it." We focused on one thing at a time, and I'd get it done. "Just keep trying," she encouraged me. "You'll get it. I have all day." The panicked beating in my chest subsided. School would never be easy for me, but I began to believe I could handle it.

> And we failed because I was arrogant. We spent lots of time meeting potential investors and working up intricate website schematics, and no time learning about teachers' problems. We weren't yet focused on what counted.

> While David locked himself in a room to teach himself how to code, I focused on a single ten-week goal: to interview 200 teachers across the United States and Canada.

> he taught us to discern what was inessential, like our number of registered users. Nobody cared how many teachers registered on Remind if they never came back to use it.

> Each morning, I'd say to myself, "These are my three buckets, and what am I doing today to move the company forward?"

> too. I tried to limit myself to three or four individual objectives, tops. I printed them out and kept them close on my notepad and next to my computer, everywhere I went. Each morning, I'd say to myself, "These are my three buckets, and what am I doing today to move the company forward?"

> When I joined Google in 2004, my first job out of college, I'd never heard of OKRs. But over time, they became an indispensable compass to help me and my teams navigate through Google and get the most important work done.

> We don't hire smart people to tell them what to do. We hire smart people so they can tell us what to do. —Steve Jobs

> "At any given time," Aaron said, "some significant percentage of people are working on the wrong things. The challenge is knowing which ones."

> Aaron Levie, founder and CEO of Box, the enterprise cloud company. "At any given time," Aaron said, "some significant percentage of people are working on the wrong things. The challenge is knowing which ones."
